This project contains an application. This application creates an interactive web app on localhost:9000. Once in the application. The application will default to the homepage. This calls upon the controllers.Application.index(). This will return a form that allows for input. The input validation happens in the database happening in the background. Once a question is submitted, it will redirect to the answer page. The answer page accesses the database, and does a look up in the database. If it cannot find the question in the database, it will persist the new question into the database and randomly generate an answer. If it can, then it will look up the answer and question in the database for displaying. There is a back button that then will let the user go back to the main page.
